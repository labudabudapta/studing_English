part 5(speaking).cor

In  this picture I can see a typical English town. There are a lot of private houses which are very 
close to each other. I think, it's a very typical English town with very little space near the houses,
normally used for gardens. The advantages of living in a private house are: it's your own space, and I 
remember an English proverb: "An Englishmen's house is his castle". The main disadvantage is a living in 
the house is rather expensive because you have to repair everything in the house from the basement to 
the roof with your own money. You should be a middle class at least to have such a house.

In this photograph I can see a beach. There are a lot of high-rise buildings there and there are some 
peaople there too. The peaople are swiming and sunbathing. The key advantage of living in apartment is 
that you pay less money for the rennovation compared with the private house. The disadvantage is that you 
have neighbors up and down. And they may be noisy. I think, the owners of these departments don't really 
live in them. They rather give these appartments for rent.
