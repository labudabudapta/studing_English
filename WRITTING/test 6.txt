TEST 6 (WRITING)

1. Hi Peter. Thanks for your letter. The Majestic Hotel sounds good, but I think, just like you, it'll be too expensive. 
Don't you think it would be better to spend the money for rather a great music band than the Hotel, do you? As for the 
people, just won't invite Dave Dee Dozy, Beaky, Mick And Tich. And we will have a lot of space for the party (those guys 
all the same won't be drinking). You have asked me about present... If she likes travelling, just let's buy for her one 
of that briefcases on the wheels. I think, she won't be dissappointed. If you need help, sorry, but I won't came the day 
before the party: I planned to make a theatre performance and so on. But I reassure you, I won't late for the main party. 
By the way, one of my frined plays the guitar in the band. I think she'll like the style. So, I'm going to talk to him 
about their performance right now. So long.

waiting for the flood in his flat (and, what a pity, his neighbors down had just bleached their ceilling). What might be worse?
But, all in all, it did. He stayed at the leers beeing absolutely naked and shouted looking down: "Janitor, Janitooor!" And there, 
in the basement he saw as the frontdoor opened and a lot of people came in. He recognized some of them and their heart started 
knoking harder, because these ones lived on the top floor. There was no place to hide. He sat on the flor putting his hands on 
his head, and silently hated the Bronko's doors for their wish not to open.
