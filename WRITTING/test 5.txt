test 5
1. Hi Michael! I appreciate your letter. I must say that everyone from our group (everybody) 
is looking forward to coming to your college. I'm sure it will be useful for our English learning: 
you know, to have a chance to speak to native English students, get to know something new about 
your culture and so on. That's why we would prefer to stay rather with someone English speaking 
family than in a hostel. Some students from my group are fans of Arsenal. Speaking trully, I'm too. 
So, it will be a great event for us, if we attend a home match. If you can help with it, all of us 
would be pleased. By the way, what about the weather in September? I think, it won't be cheap to 
take a lot of unnecessary clothes with us by plane. Please, tell us about it in your response letter.
Best regards.
