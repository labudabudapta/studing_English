test 5
1. Hi Michael! I appreciate your letter. I must say that everyone from our group (everybody) 
is looking forward to coming to your college. I'm sure it will be useful for our English learning: 
you know, to have a chance to speak to native English students, get to know something new about 
your culture and so on. That's why we would prefer to stay rather with someone English speaking 
family than in a hostel. Some students from my group are fans of Arsenal. Speaking trully, I'm too. 
So, it will be a great event for us, if we attend a home match. If you can help with it, all of us 
would be pleased. By the way, what about the weather in September? I think, it won't be cheap to 
take a lot of unnecessary clothes with us by plane. Please, tell us about it in your response letter.
Best regards.

2. Speaking trully I suppose, the idea about the most convenient  way of travelling (by car or by public 
transport) is important. As for me, I prefer travelling by car. Firstly, you can plan your route the way 
you want and not to be depended on transport companies. And this is my main reason: suppose you feel bored 
with walking down gloomy fog London street. What a problem? Just get into your car and leave for the hills 
of Liverpool's outscirts in no time at all. Secondly, you may stop your car at any moment if you want. Thirdly, 
you may get your bicycle with you and pedal through the distant areas which are located too far from road for 
example. This way you'll have a chance to look at a real precincts, I mean the places not for the tourists that 
may be of interest. But if you can't afford such travelling, you may choose public transport, and this will cost 
you comparatively cheaper.
