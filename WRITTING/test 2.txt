1. Hi Sam.
I appreciate your letter. I'll be glad to help you with your project. I hope, it isn't that kind of pictures where 
people have to exhibit ourselves without clothes, is it? So, if it is not I'll ready to help you. The weather now is 
quite bitter, so I think it will be better if we choose an indorse place. How about my garrage? There is my bike
there. And you can include it to the pictures's theme. It isn't something special for me. Moreover it doesn't beautiful
and valuable at all. Nevertheless, the thing appropriate the place where it located. So, if you don't mind, I think I 
will be able to do my garrage before your arrival. I have just one question to you: How much time it will taken to paint
a picture like this? I mean, I will bore quickly enough if I have to stay silent for a long time. But anyway, I believe
the result will be great. So, I will be looking forward your coming.

Take care.

2. Zmiiv area has got a lot of good places but the most famous, I think, is the knolls. This place located outskirts but it 
won't take far too much time if go there from the center: the town is rather small than big. Moreover the scenery is 
fantastic and the sight from the height of 100 meters or something is great. That's why, I think, the place is the best to 
camp. As for the best time of a year for the camping I'd say the beginning of the October when trees around are in a yellow 
(but the spring is also not bad). If you are going to camp in autumn, don't forget to bring some warm clothes, because the 
weather may be a little cold in this time of season. By the way, if you want to stay camping at night, you should take some 
waterproof clothes either: it might be raining during the nights. All in all, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed. Welcom to 
Zmiiv and so long.
