part 1:

- Where are you from?
- I'm from Kharkiv, Ukraine.

- What do you like about living...?
- First of all, this city is comfortable for living because there are a lot of employments. Moreover, my native town isn't
far from there. So it's easy to me to set off, let's say at weekends, from my place in Kharkiv to parent's house where the
nature is perfect and where all my friends live. 

- What kind of music do you listen?
- I prefer to listen all music except rap and classic music. Mostly, I like metal. 

- When do you listen to music?
- I like listen music during lunch time through my headphones or while driving my car.

- Do you enjoy watching films?
- Yes I do. It's good to spent some time watching a good film especially after a hard day.

- Tell us about a film you have enjoyed recently.
- I have remembered a one comedy named "Gentlemen Broncos". It's a good comedy and some good actors played leading roles in this movie.
This film tells about a boy who likes writing novels. One of these novel had been stolen by his idol. But all in all 
everything ended happily. This film is good because it's kind and it's about a friendship and family relationships. And I think,
I will watch it one more time in the nearest future.

- Do you think you will use English a lot in the future? (In what ways?)
- I hope my next job will be bind with English. Moreover, it will help me to improve my English. I'd like to use it, it's says,
during business trip or something.

- What other language would you like to learn? (Why?)
- I think, I'd learn Franch or Italian. Because the first one is more useful from rest European languages (I mean except English).
The second one is more simple to learn.

- What is your favorite place for a holiday? (Why?)
- I like Karpaty because of it's a group of mountains. Anyway, if I go to the holiday, I'll chose such place where mountains are located.

- What do you enjoy doing on holiday?
- On my holiday, I enjoy traveling if the money allow.

part 2:
- In the first photograph I can see two byciclists. They ride through the field and apparently, they speack about something. In the second 
photograph I can see people skiting in the skating rink. There are some high-rise buildings in the background. Apparently, the skating rink is
located in the downtown or something. As for the first photograph, I'd say that people choose such sport activities because it's cheapest
way to see the world. By the way bycicle is a great way to keep oneself in good fit. And as for the second photo, I'd say the skating 
rink is a good way to spent time funny with your friends or family. And I think it won't take you too much time to get the nearest ice 
rink in your city if you are a very busy person.

- Have you ever been ice skating?
- Yes, I have. I wouldn't say I skating skates permanently but maybe two times or so in the year.

- In the first photograph I can see two children and, apparently, their mother. They are in the toy shop. They are going to buy some 
toys or table games. In the second photograph I can see a market. There are a lot of people there. I can see the woman buying some 
vegetables in the forefront also. If talking about first photograph, I'd say people choose such places if they want to buy goods and 
take varanty if something goes wrong. One way or another, a specialize shop gives you a widest choise. As for the markets, I'd say 
people buy goods in such places if they wanted to save their money, or they like to drive a bargain.

- Do you enjoy shopping?
- Yes I do. Spent money is easier than to earn (it).

part 3:

- In the seven photographs I can see some different ways of peoplpe's leisure. First of all I'd want to say that all people are different,
that's why somebody prefers to play in a music band (if his skills to allow him to do that). Someone likes to attend such crowded places 
like nightclubs or to cheer on his favorite football team. Or by contrast to spent time growing flowers for sale. The matter is a  city
can approve chance to almost everyone for fulfillment their desires whether to engage a work that they love or spent time for favorite leisure.
- As for me, I like football. So a chance to go on the stadium and cheer on a local team will be great. From all rest pictures I'd emphasis
the firs one for myself. It's a goot to spend some time playing music instrument, but playing in a band or in a company of friends is
a great event.

part 4:

- What are the disadvantages of living in a big city?
- At first, the most disadvantage in a living in a big city is an air polution. I can see a great difference between an air in the Kharkiv
and Zmiiv (it's my native town), where the traffic isn't so hard like in a big town. Secondly, the living in a village or in a smal town 
is more calm and less stressable I think.

- Why do you think some people choose to live in the center of cities?
- I think the living in a badsit, or flat in center of city is more universal because you can change your job, if needed, and you won't feel 
efficient disadvantage with changing your route to the place where you working. I mean, if your newest work is located, let's say in other part 
of the city, you won't be dissappointed with this changing. And the other cause, I think, people chose place like center of city because they 
think it will be more safe, it may be criminal in distant area of the town.

- What is special about your capital city?
- The capital of Ukrain is Kiiv. But telling the true I don't fell it's a special city. Maybe, if I can live there some time, I will change 
my opinion. But I visited Kiiv several times and I can't say it liked to me: as for me, it's an ordinary city with crowded streets in center, 
there are a hard traffic there and so on.

- Some people say that the living in a city can be very lonely. What do you think?
- I think so. If you live on your own, your feeling of lonely can be raised in a big city. I think so because lonely people living in a city 
seeing a lot of companies of people going to and fro and their feeling of lonely can be raised.

- Would you prefer to live in a very modern city or an old one with lots of history? Why?
- If I can chose, I'd prefer to live in an old city with lots of history. As for me old buildings with history are much more interesting to look 
comparing with modern concrete buildings.

- Is there a city you would like to visit in the future? Why?
- Of course. There are a lot of cities which I'd like to visit. If it's up to me to make a choise, I'll say Amsterdam. Because I heard a lot 
about this city and I was interested with it. It may be some problems with the language which I don't know, but I hope my English will be enough.
