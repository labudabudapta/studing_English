test 3

Part 1:
FREE TIME
- Are you an active person in your free time? (What sorts of things do you do?)
- Yes, I am. When I'm not busy, I prefer to spent time riding my bike or motorcycle.

- When did you last play a sport? (What was it?)
- It was an early of January, 2019, just after the Cristmas had ended. I was playing footbal as always the way on week-ends and received 
an injury one of my knee. So after some kind of reabilitations I decided to give up playing footbal at all, and concentrated on something 
less traumatic, like biking.

TRAVEL
- Which country would you most like to visit? (Why?)
- Threre are a lot of Countries which I'd like to visit. I think the special one for me is Norway. At first it's located so far from 
Ukrain that you due to go through some onthers countries and see some interesting on your way. At second there are mountains named 
Fjords there and the Atlantic ocean.

- Do you prefer going on holiday in a small group or a large group? (Why?)
- I'd like going on my holiday in a small group. But sometimes I think about going wherever on holiday by myself, because only such way 
you can meet people and know something new about their culture. I mean while you travel with your company you as if restrict by your 
own company.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
- What is your favorite time of year? (Why?)
- My favorite time of year is spring. Because biking is bound with warm wether most of all, so, I like spring.

- Do you think you will always have the same friends? (Why? / Why not?)
- I'd like it will be like this. 

Part 2:
- In the first photograph I can see a waterfall. There are some people there watching it. In the second picture I can see a more calm 
river. There are some people sitting in the bank. They ensconced comfortably with some food and drink. Peolpe from first photograph came 
to this place to watch sight, maybe a great creature of nature in their area. Someone, perhaps, intended to take some picture or to have 
picture taken in the background of waterfall. As for the second photograph, I'd say people enjoying to spend time this place being far from 
noisy traffic or crowded places of a big city. It's just a calm silent place where some friiends or a family can spent some time private 
with nature.

- Which of these rivers would you prefer to visit?
- I'd like to visit the river from first photograph. The matter is a waterfall isn't ordinary sight in an area where I live.

- In the first photograph I can see a girl and two woman, perhaps they are her mother and grandmother. They are cooking in the kitchen.
In the second photograph I can see some chefs. Comparing with people from first photograph, I'd say the cooking is their job. People from 
first photograph are due to supply all ingredients by themselves comparing with people from second one. But all these chiefs that shows in 
the second picture apparently are more responsible for their results.

- Do you enjoy cooking?
- Yes I do. But in case it's happening not frequently than one or two times in the week.

Part 3:
- How would these ideas help people to get to know each other?
- Which idea would be the most successful?

- There are eight photographs there and each one shows some kind of communication between people. In the first photo I can see a music band 
and some people that came to listen their music. I think it's a very cultural way to spent time and know each other. But I think the 
preparation for such kind of meeting would be too hard. It means that some of neighbors have to play some kind of music instrument. Then they 
have to preparate some compositions together, and it means they have spent a lot of time for repetitioins. I think it's a hard way to start to 
know each other at all. In the second photograph I can see four people (maybe a real quiantity of people is higher). The man is cooking some 
sausages and the women are talking each other while a child bothering one of them. I think it's a good way to organaize a first meeting of 
neighbors. It won't be reach and take too much time to have everything prepared. As I have understand, people from third photograph are going 
to make an excursion trip. I think it's a good way to know each other. Somehow or other, they will be have some common memories and will be able 
to discuss them in the nearest future. In the fourth photograph I can see a lot of people sitting at a big table and some of them are standing 
near it. The topic isn't too differ from the photo number two, so I think a resume will be the same. In the fifth photograph I can see some 
people talking something in a front yard of somebody's house and drinking. I think it won't be hard to get some bottle of soda and talking to
one of your neighbors something, having arranged beforehand to discuss some question like about how to organize cooperative barbeque or 
something. Running ahead I'd say it's a best way to start a conversation. In the sixth photograph I can see people painting a brick fence - a good
way to spent time together and with benefit. The main thing a lord of the fence have to realize about consequenses. If he isn't object about it, 
it may be fun. In the seventh photograph I can see a lot of people. They are playing voleyball in the sports ground and some people wathing their 
game. I think a sport game is a good way to union some people together. In the final, eight photograph I can see how some people are planting 
a garden. But I think this way of communication is fit only for the housewives. So, if I were one of their neighbors I'd propose something from 
photograps number five or seven.
