part 1:

- Where are you from?
- I'm from Kharkiv, Ukraine.

- What do you like about living...?
- First of all, this city is comfortable for living because there are a lot of employments. Moreover, my native town isn't
far from there. So it's easy for me to set off, let's say at weekends, from my place in Kharkiv to parents' house where the
nature is perfect and where all my friends live. 

- What kind of music do you listen?
- I prefer to listen to all kinds of music except rap and classical music. Mostly, I like heavy metal. 

- When do you listen to music?
- I like to listen to music at lunch time with my headphones on or while driving my car.

- Do you enjoy watching films?
- Yes I do. It's good to spent some time watching a good film especially after a hard working day.

- Tell us about a film you have enjoyed recently.
- I have remembered a comedy named "Gentlemen Broncos". It's a good comedy and some good actors starred in this movie.
This film tells about a boy who likes writing novels. One of his novel was stolen by his idol. But all in all 
everything ends happily. This film is good because it's kind and it's about a friendship and family relationship. And I think,
I will watch it one more time in the nearest future.

- Do you think you will use English a lot in the future? (In what ways?)
- I hope my next job will be bind with English. Moreover, it will help me to improve my English. I'd like to use it, let's say,
during business trips or something like that.

- What other language would you like to learn? (Why?)
- I think, I'd learn French or Italian, because the first one is more useful from other European languages (I mean except English).
The second one is more simple to learn.

- What is your favorite place for a holiday? (Why?)
- I like Karpaty because of it's a mountain chain. Anyway, if I go for a holiday, I'll choose such place where mountains are located.

- What do you enjoy doing on holiday?
- On my holiday, I enjoy travelling if the money allows.

part 2:
- In the first photograph I can see two byciclists. They ride through the field and apparently, they speak about something. In the second 
photograph I can see some people skating on the skating rink. There are some high-rise buildings in the background. Apparently, the skating rink is
located in the downtown or something. As for the first photograph, I'd say that people choose such sport activities because it's the cheapest
way to see the world. By the way, bycicle is a great way to keep oneself in a good shape. And as for the second photo, I'd say the skating 
rink is a good way to have a good time with your friends or family. And I think it won't take you too much time to get the nearest ice 
rink in your city if you are a very busy person.

- Have you ever been ice skating?
- Yes, I have. I wouldn't say I skate permanently, maybe, two times or so in a year.

- In the first photograph I can see two children and, apparently, their mother. They are in a toy shop. They are going to buy some 
toys or table games. In the second photograph I can see a market. There are a lot of people there. I can see a woman buying some 
vegetables in the forefront also. If talking about the first photograph, I'd say people choose such places if they want to buy goods and 
take varanty if something goes wrong. One way or another, a specialized shop gives you the widest choise. As for the markets, I'd say 
people buy goods in such places if they want to save their money, or they like to drive a bargain.

- Do you enjoy shopping?
- Yes I do. Spending money is easier than  earning it.

part 3:

- In the seven photographs I can see some different ways of peoplpe's leisure. First of all I'd want to say that all people are different,
that's why somebody prefers to play in a music band (if his skills allow him to do that). Someone likes to attend such crowded places 
like nightclubs or to cheer on his favorite football team. Or by contrast to spent time growing flowers for sale. The matter is a  city
can give a chance to almost everyone for fulfillment their desires whether to engage the work they love or to spend time on favorite leisure.
- As for me, I like football. So a chance to go to the stadium and cheer on a local team will be great. From all rest pictures I'd emphasise
the first one for myself. It's good to spend some time playing musical instrument, but playing in a band or in a company of friends is
a great event.

part 4:

- What are the disadvantages of living in a big city?
- At first, the most disadvantage in a living in a big city is an air polution. I can see a great difference between the air in Kharkiv
and Zmiiv (it's my native town), where the traffic isn't so hard like it is in a big town. Secondly, living in the country or in a small town 
is more calm and less stressable, I think.

- Why do you think some people choose to live in the center of cities?
- I think living in a badsit, or flat in center of the city is more universal because you can change your job, if needed, and you won't feel 
efficient disadvantage with changing your route to the place where you are working. I mean, if your newest work is located, let's say in other part 
of the city, you won't be dissappointed with this changing. And the other reason, I think, people choose the place like city center   because they 
think it will be safer, than it may be in a criminal distant  or on the outskirts of  the town.

- What is special about your capital city?
- The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv. But telling the truth I don't feel it's a special city. Maybe, if I can live there for some time, I will change 
my opinion. But I visited Kyiv several times and I can't say I liked it: as for me, it's an ordinary city with crowded streets in the center, 
there is a heavytraffic there and so on.

- Some people say that living in a city can be very lonely. What do you think?
- I think so. If you live on your own, your feeling of loneliness can be raised in a big city. I think so because lonely people living in a city 
see a lot of companies of people going to and fro and their feeling of loneliness can be raised.

- Would you prefer to live in a very modern city or an old one with lots of history? Why?
- If I can chose, I'd prefer to live in an old city with lots of history. As for me, old buildings with history are much more interesting to look at
comparing with modern concrete buildings.

- Is there a city you would like to visit in the future? Why?
- Of course. There are a lot of cities which I'd like to visit. If it's up to me to make a choise, I'll say, Amsterdam. Because I've heard a lot 
about this city and I am interested in it. It may be some problems with the language which I don't know, but I hope my English will be enough.
