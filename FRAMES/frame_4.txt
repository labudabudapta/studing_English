FRAME 4

part 1:

Personal expetience
- Do you enjoy buying presents for people? (Is it ever difficul to buy for someone?)
- Yes I do, but I think to gift the presents is more enjoyable. I think if you aren't restricted by financial part, 
you will be able to have a lot of variants and it won't be too hard to select something useful, and finally will 
pleasure a person for that you selected a gift.

- What was the best present you receive recently? (Who give it to you?)
- I received headphones from my wife last summer. She presented it to me for our annyversary. The headphones were 
really good and it sounded beeter than my previous ones. And I still uses it.

Daily life
- Is your weekday routine different from your weekend routine? (In what ways?)
- Yes of course. First of all I afford myself to sleep a bit more on weekends. At second, if I go to country, it's 
says to my parent's house, I'll ride my bike or motorcycle, so my day will pass more activitly comparing to my weekdays.

- What do you look forward to at the end of the day?
- It depends from what day of the week is. If we talk about weekdays I look forward to relax at the dinner table, to play 
a little with my daughter and watch an interesting movie with wife. If we talk about weekend days I'd prefer to spent some 
time going whenever, perhaps with my friends.

Media
- How much TV do you watch? (What kind programs do you enjoy?)
- I have no TV. Sometimes I watch football matches on the air or some kinds of clips about motorcycles and trips in youtube. 
Sometimes I watch clips about politics from blogers I prefer to watch, and like.

- Do you buy magazines or newspapers regularly? (Why? / Why not?)
- No, I don't. The matter is, I can accertain any news from internet. It's more comfortable for me, and I think you can get 
news more operatively in this way.

part 2:

- Why do people to choose to go to beaches like these?
- In the first photograph I can see a beech. I think the beaches like this is located a bit far from big cities, because 
there are not so many people and buildings near here. I think it's located in some kind of island or something.
In the second photograph I can see a beach also. But this time the beach is crowded. There are a lot of people there. Basing on 
the scenery, I'd say the beach is located near a big city. I think the beaches like from first photograph should choose if you 
are going to surfing. It is fit if you want to relax in silent place without all that noise which may be from crowded places. 
People choose to go to beaches like from second photograph if they don't want to spent too much time for a trip. I think, people 
just live somwhere near sach beaches.

- Which beach would you prefer to go to?
- Without a doubt, I'd prefer to go to the beach from the first photograph.

- What can be difficult about doing these things?
- In the first photograph I can see a desert. There is a car there overcoming the dunes. In the second photograph I can see a 
group of mountaineers. They are going through snow and there are some mountains in the background. If talking about difficulties, 
I'd say it's too hard to keep himself concentrated during a long time driving through the desert. Looking at the second photograph, 
I'd say that it's difficult to overcome all that hardships which mountains could bring to their guests. I mean a cold, a bitter 
wind and like.

- Would you like to do eigher of these things?
- Yes, I do. I like mountains, so I'd choose to go, or climb on the top of mountain.

part 3:

- In the ten photograph I can see people doing their jobs. I'd share all this jobs in two categories: first, where people have to 
do a drab, maybe a boreing job and second, where they do their job which is much more creative than, it's say to work in scullery 
or to pick up the garbage from the floor. I think the most interesting job from that which have been represented is to work a tour 
guide. Besides, if you have to do sach work for a short time, you won't be bored with it at all.

part 4:

- What is more important, earning the money or enjoying the job? Why?
- I'd say to earn the money is more important than enjoying the job. Because the main goal in going to work is earning the money.

- Why do you think some people have to wear uniforms at work?
- I think I can point two base goals: first, it may protect them if need and second, uniforms takes workers more prominent.

- What do you think would be most interesting about working abroad? Why?
- As for me, a business trips, let's say in scope of a country will be interesting for me.

- Do you think languages can help people in their jobs? Why?
- I think so. Why not. It'll help to find a better job. Somehow or other, if you know some language you will have more variants to choose.

- How important is it to learn about different jobs when you are at school? Why?
- You have to gather as much as possible imformation about different jobs in order to choose your own dirrection in studying. It's 
important to decide upon your future profession as fast as possible also. If you can do that you'll be have much more chances to become 
a real professional.

- Would you prefer to work for a big or a small company? Why?
- It doesn't any matter for me. But as my own experience I'd say it's better to work in a small company. In this case you can know your 
coworkers much more better. Anyhow, having worked in a big company I communicated with not a big group of people. So as I say earlier, 
it doesn't any matter.
